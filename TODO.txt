	Cleaning up:
	------------

	Is it enough to populate the scene graph with entities in the loading game state,
	or do I need to store the whole created map (as opposed to creating a map preview entity for a widget).

	Map creation:
	-------------

	1.) MOBA arena creation:
		procedurally establishing bases, lanes, arenas, jungle, blocked and undecided areas
		procedurally creating transition areas and blocked areas
		procedurally creating random areas
		procedurally placing actors
	2.) Deathmatch arena creation:
		procedurally establishing bases, arenas, blocked and undecided areas
		procedurally placing actors


	Entity creation:
	----------------

	1.) Background entities:

	2.) Static and dynamic gameplay entities:

	3.) GUI entities / widgets:


	Scene graph rendering:
	----------------------

	1.) Plain Canvas:

	2.) WebGL / Shaders with normal an depth maps:

	Game logic:
	-----------
	
		Menu:
	
		Gameplay MOBA:
	
		Gameplay Deathmatch:
	
	Music:
	------
	
		Procedural?
	
	Sound Effects:
	--------------
	
		What to do, here?
